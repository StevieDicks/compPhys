Exam: 
3 problems, 2 hours, 3 programs...bring whatever would help.

section 3.2.
must close output file before reading it
use fopen so you don't have to pipe data
FILE is data type for data streams. Define pointers.

sec 3.3
see ex35.c for good example (Planck program) on file I/O

sec 3.4
how to initialize matrix
unit offset vectors have 1 instead of 0
     ex: r = vector(0,100) --> r[0]...r[100]
     ex: r = vector(1,100) --> r[1]...r[100]
     unit offset:
use a pointer to define:
     	  C = c-1; //where c[4] is vector from 0 to 3
	  vector C will go from 1 to 4 instead of 0 to 3
	  

sec 3.5 best practices in C











These feelings of the past are so vivid. 
I feel things through my memory
  that I thought I wouldn't feel again--
  lost in the abyss of forgottenness.
I don't know why this has been happening.
Perhaps I'm finding things out about myself
  that I thought should be left behind;
  good things so far, feelings I used
  to love and look forward to; feelings
  I knew were central to life.
And perhaps I learned to deny these feelings.
As I grew older, I learned things that
  would override these. But the things I learned
  taught me new feelings, and those new feelings
  have brought things like anxiety and numbness.
